# 🌍 AQI Index Analysis Dashboard | Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an interactive Air Quality Index (AQI) analysis dashboard built using Power BI.
It allows users to explore air quality data dynamically across different years, states, and cities.

The dashboard helps transform raw AQI data into meaningful insights related to pollution severity,
dominant pollutants, regional patterns, and seasonal trends.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
• Analyze AQI trends across time and geography  
• Classify AQI levels from Good to Hazardous  
• Identify highly polluted cities and regions  
• Understand dominant pollutants impacting air quality  
• Build an interactive and user-friendly dashboard  

---

## 📊 Dashboard Features
• Dynamic slicers for Year, State, and City  
• AQI level categorization (Good → Hazardous)  
• City-wise AQI comparison  
• State-level AQI visualization using map  
• Monthly AQI trend analysis  
• Pollutant frequency analysis (PM2.5, PM10, O₃, etc.)  
• Conditional formatting based on AQI standards  

---

## 📈 Key Insights
• AQI severity varies significantly across regions and time  
• Some cities consistently experience Unhealthy to Hazardous AQI levels  
• PM2.5 and PM10 are the most dominant pollutants  
• Seasonal patterns reveal periods of extreme pollution  
• Peak AQI values highlight serious public health risks

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
• Power BI Desktop  
• DAX (calculated columns and measures)  
• Power Query for data cleaning  
• Data modeling  
• Interactive visualizations  

---

## 🧮 AQI Classification Logic
• Good: ≤ 50  
• Moderate: 51 – 100  
• Poor: 101 – 150  
• Unhealthy: 151 – 200  
• Very Unhealthy: 201 – 300  
• Hazardous: > 300

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Download the .pbix file from this repository  
2. Open it in Power BI Desktop  
3. Use slicers to filter Year, State, and City  
4. Interact with visuals to explore insights
